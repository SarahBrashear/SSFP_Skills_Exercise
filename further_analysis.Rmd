# Estimated Median Home Values
# Since the municipalities generate revenue primarily through property taxes,
# estimated median home value may also be an important consideration when 
# deciding how to distribute municipal aid equitably. 

# For example, two towns could have comparable ratings on the SES index I've
# created here, and yet be generating dramatically different amounts of revenue
# through property taxes. 

summary(clean_data$estimated_median_home_value)

# Estimated Median Home Values range from $128,800 to $1,461,100. Again, this
# indicates wide disparity of wealth between towns.
# Mean = $322,062; Median = $278,700
# Vast majority of towns have median home values < $500,000.

# Visualizing the spread of estimated median home values:
home_value_plot <- clean_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimated_median_home_value)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(count)/sum(stat(count))),
                 bins = 70) +

# Ultimately, I decided this consideration falls outside the scope of the skills 
# exercise. Rather than being factored into the holistic measure of town 
# socioeconomic status, the median home value data ought to be part of the 
# allocation formula itself, along with other factors such as property tax rates 
# and population size.
